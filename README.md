What the program does:
## Import:
With a couple commands it will prompt me to load the latest inventory and estimate spreadsheets to be updated.

Another command lets me check the records that will be modified in the main inventory sheet, and their values before and after updating. If the product number is mistyped there is an output warning. It also adds a couple columns with the date and time that the inventory is being updated.
## Export:
A couple commands will let the user quickly save the updated inventory spreadsheet, estimates record, and plots in a folder with date (date of entry) automatically included.
