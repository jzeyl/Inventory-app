# Inventory-app

This is a simple database app. I created one before knowing much about SQL so it's implemented in Python only, creating. The other option was just a few short SQL scripts and viewing in a software (I used [DB Browser for SQLITE](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)).

# 1 - Python code with  no SQL
The main functionality is to update the main inventory spreadsheet using another spreadsheet, 'estimates', which indicates the products used at each sale. With a couple commands it will prompt the user to load the latest inventory and estimate spreadsheets to be updated.  An 'add record' command prompts for user input of the estimate ID, product numbers, and quantities. Other commands let me check the records that will be updated in the main inventory sheet, and their values before and after updating. If the new record product number is mistyped relative to the inventory spreadsheet, there is an output warning. The code also adds a couple columns with the date and time that the inventory is being updated. A couple commands will let the user quickly save the updated inventory spreadsheet, estimates record, and plots in a folder with date (date of entry) automatically included.

Functions
|  Function name | Description   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  import_inventory() | Prompts opening of file viewer to select inventory spreadsheet  |   |   |   |
|  import_estimates() | Prompts opening of file viewer to select estimates spreadsheet   |   |   |   |
|  add_record | Prompts the user to input new 'estimate' record  |   |   |   |
|  clear_record() | Removes the added record  |   |   |   |
|  view_record() | Prints the added record as a dataframe  |   |   |   |
|  view_products_to_update() | Prints the rows that will be updated in the 'inventory' spreadsheet based on the added record  |   |   |   |
|  update_inventory() | Creates a new 'inventory' dataframe with updated values  |   |   |   |
|  view_modified_products() | View the cells that were modified  |   |   |   |
|  save_inventory() | Save updated 'inventory' spreadsheet with a datestamp  |   |   |   |
|  save_estimates() | Save updated 'estimates' spreadsheet with a datestamp  |   |   |   |
|  saveplot() |  Save bar plots of inventory, grouped by product category with a datestamp |   |   |   |


# 2 SQL commands
The other option is a few codes of SQL and a software. New values are added by modifying a table in DB Brower and including the text 'add' in the corresponding cells in an adjacent column to indicate which new records to add.
